==========================
Unsupported Python version
==========================

This version of Poseidon requires Python {}.{}, but you're trying to
install it on Python {}.{}.

This may be because you are using a version of pip that doesn't
understand the python_requires classifier. Make sure you
have pip >= 9.0 and setuptools >= 24.2, then try again:

    $ python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools
    $ python -m pip install Poseidon-test

This will install the latest version of Poseidon which works on your
version of Python. If you can't upgrade your pip (or Python), request
an older version of Poseidon.
